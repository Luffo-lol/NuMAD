# Numerical Manufacturing And Design Tool (NuMAD)
NuMAD (Numerical Manufacturing And Design) is an open-source software tool written in MATLAB which simplifies the process of creating a three-dimensional model of a wind turbine blade. The graphical, user-friendly tool manages all blade information including airfoils, materials, and material placement. NuMAD uses the blade information to generate input files for other tools:

    The ANSYS® commercial finite element package
    The NWTC codes PreComp, BModes, and FAST
    PLOT3D file format for CFD mesh building

When used in conjunction with these other tools, NuMAD provides computation of blade cross section properties, analysis of blade buckling, and estimation of blade aeroelastic instability. The user’s manual (SAND2012-7028) describes the capabilities and usage of NuMAD.
