# Numerical Manufacturing And Design (NuMAD) Tool 
NuMAD (Numerical Manufacturing And Design) is an object-oriented, open-source software program written in Matlab which simplifies the process of creating a three-dimensional model of a wind turbine blade. The tool manages all blade information including aerodynamic, and material properties as well as, material placement. The blade information can be modified by a structural-optimizer in NuMAD or it can be used to run other tools in a stand-alone mode:

    The ANSYSÂ® commercial finite element package
    The NWTC codes PreComp, BModes, and FAST
    PLOT3D file format for CFD mesh building

When used in conjunction with these other tools, NuMAD provides computation of blade cross section properties, various structural analyses, and estimation of blade aeroelastic instability.

## Installation Instructions
1. Install [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
2. Open `paths.m` in an editor and set the `NuMAD_path` to the `source` directory in the repo. Save and close `paths.m`.
3. Move the `paths.m` file to the MATLAB directory of your user account (e.g. C:\Users\username\Documents\MATLAB)

Every time a new MATLAB session is started type `paths` to be able to run NuMAD
