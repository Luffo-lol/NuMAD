## NuMAD Source Directories

- **toolbox**: contains basic functions and operations needed for performing analysis with packages such as precomp, BPE, and ANSYS
- **objects**: contains the class definition of the blade object, which stores the geometric, airfoil and material data for a given blade design
- **optimization**: contains bundles of tools for several purposes, including ``runIEC``, file processing functions for input and output from other programs such as FAST and Crunch, and setup and execution of ANSYS models for analyzing quantities like material rupture, fatigue, and buckling under loading
