## NuMAD Source Directories

- **numadGUI**: Files related to the graphical user interface (GUI) which was introduced in NuMAD v2.0.
- **numadObjects**: Files associated to the class definition of the blade object and ``.yaml`` file capabilities.
- **utilities**:  Files used during optimizations (e.g. running IEC design load cases, structural constraint evaluation). These codes can also be run stand-alone outside of an optimization. They are not explicitly called by the GUI files.
